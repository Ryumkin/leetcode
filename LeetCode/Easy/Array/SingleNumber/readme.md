# Single-Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



_Example 1:_

`
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
`

`
Output: 1
`


_Example 2:_

`
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
`

`
Output: 4
`


_Example 3:_

`
Input: nums = [1]
`

`
Output: 1
`


_Constraints:_

`
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
`

`
-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
`

Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
